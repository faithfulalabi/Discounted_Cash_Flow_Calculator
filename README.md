# Discounted_Cash_Flow_Calculator: Project Overview

The motivation behind this project is due to the fact that I manage my own investment portfolio, and love learning about different ways to analyze and manage a portfolio. One of my favorite investment Youtube Channels (Learn to Invest) created a [Discounted Cash Flow explanation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd_emLLzJnk&list=WL&index=9&t=631s&ab_channel=LearntoInvest) and an excel template to use for yourself. Every weekend I would use his excel template to quantitatively analyze companies I was interested in investing in. After learning Python I knew life would be so much easier automating this process. rather than me spending an hour every weekend to determine what price to buy a company, I now spend seconds to determine it because I wrote this code. It not only tells me the price to buy a company, but also over a 10 year period it gives me their average revenue growth rate, their buy price with their total debt factored in, their average free cashflow to net income margins, their average revenue to net income margins, their weight of asset, and their weight of debt.
